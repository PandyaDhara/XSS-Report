Summary: In acunetix website has an endpoint that is vulnerable to an injection vulnerability - namely a reflected injection of JavaScript, also known as Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS). As per OWASP's definition: "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites." 

Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Domain : http://vulnweb.com
Sub-Domain : http://testasp.vulnweb.com/

Description:
Reflected XSS arises when an application takes some input from an HTTP request and embeds that input into the immediate response in an unsafe ways.

Steps To Reproduce:

3.) On the search bar, enter payload:<script>alert(1)</script>
4.) Click Search then XSS will trigger.

Demonstration of the vulnerability:
PoC : 

Impact :
With user interaction, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
This would allow an attacker to unwillingly make a victim:
Perform any action in the identified endpoint
View any information that the user is able to view
Modify any information that the user is able to modify (not sure if applicable in this case)

Mitigation : If you want to prevent your website to be vulnerable of cross-site scripting then you can just enable noscript on browser.
